# A/B Test: Social Proof and User Benefit Messaging for Gift Memberships

## Summary
Test the impact on conversion rates by adding **social proof messaging** and **user benefit messaging** to the gift membership flow.

## Details
### Test Description:
- **Control**: Current flow without any additional messaging.
- **Variation A**:
  - **Social Proof Messaging**: Display tags on the Select Gift screen:
    - `"Most gifted plan!"`
    - `"Loved by 90%+ of gifters."` for the "Premium" gift.
  - **User Benefit Messaging**: Show a tooltip on the Recipient screen with the message:
    - `"You also get to play expansions that your friend hosts."`
- **Hypothesis**: Adding these messages will increase user confidence and perceived value, leading to higher gift membership conversions.

### Implementation Details:
1. **Social Proof**:
   - Add a badge or banner on the Premium membership tier with text:
     - `"Most gifted plan!"`
     - `"Loved by 90%+ of gifters."`
   - Position this near the Premium membership selection box.

2. **User Benefit Messaging**:
   - Add a tooltip or inline message near the recipient selection page:
     - `"You also get to play expansions that your friend hosts."`
   - Ensure the messaging is visible and non-intrusive.

3. **Tracking**:
   - Track visibility and engagement with the new messages (e.g., clicks on plans, tooltip interactions).
   - Track conversions for users exposed to the variation vs. control.
   - **Tracking Configurability**: Implement the ability to configure traffic splits (e.g., control 50%, variation 50%) via the admin panel or Zookeeper to allow adjustments without requiring additional deployments.

4. **Traffic Split**:
   - 50% of users will see the variation, 50% will remain in the control group.
   - Traffic split can be adjusted dynamically using the admin panel if necessary.

5. **Fallback Plan**:
   - If Variation A underperforms or introduces issues, reduce its traffic allocation from 50% to 0% via the admin panel.

6. **Test Duration**:
   - Run the test for 2 weeks to gather sufficient data for statistical significance.

## Metrics
### Primary:
- Gift membership purchase conversion rate.

### Secondary:
- Engagement with social proof messaging (e.g., % of users interacting with the "Most gifted plan!" badge).
- Engagement with user benefit messaging (e.g., % of users interacting with the tooltip).
- Exit rate per step in the funnel.
- Funnel drop-off rate per step (e.g., how many users abandon after selecting a gift plan vs. recipient selection).

### Success Criteria:
- A measurable lift in conversion rate for Variation A compared to the Control.
- Reduced exit rates and improved engagement with the added messaging elements.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement social proof messaging on the membership selection page.
- [ ] Add user benefit messaging to the recipient selection or checkout page.
- [ ] Set up tracking for interactions with new messaging, including step-specific funnel metrics.
- [ ] Define A/B segmentation logic (50% control, 50% variation) and configure it in the admin panel/Zookeeper.
- [ ] QA all elements for responsiveness on both web and mobile platforms.

## Key Knowledge
- **Existing Behavior**: Users often abandon the flow after selecting a gift plan or at the recipient selection step, potentially due to lack of confidence or perceived value.
- **Target Users**: Users visiting the gift membership overlay.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Social proof messaging is visible near the membership tiers for 50% of users.
2. User benefit messaging is integrated into the recipient selection step.
3. A/B segmentation is correctly applied, and tracking data is collected for both groups.
4. No technical or UI bugs across all platforms.
5. Funnel metrics (e.g., exit rates and drop-off rates) are accurately captured for analysis.
